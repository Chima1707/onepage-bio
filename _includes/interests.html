			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Functional Programming</b>. I learned programming using object oriented languages like Java and C#. 
				 Recently their has been much buzz about functional programming and its constructs such as monads, functors, pure functions etc.
				 When I first looked at FP I was really astonished about all its benefits, and being the kind of person that I am, I jumped in.
				 Initially it was difficult understanding its concepts, but, overtime I'm begining to 
				 grasp it. I learned a couple of FP languages such as Haskell and Purescript but have not used them in production yet.
				 These languages have really improved the way I reason about and write JavaScript at work.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Soccer</b>. I've always loved soccer from childhood - I still train with a team called westend super warriors in my city every weekend.
          Am also a die hard fan of Chelsea FC in London.
			  </li>
			  <li>
					<b>History</b>. Learning about history is one of the most favourite things I do online when i'm not writing codes. Of recent, 
					I have been fascinated about ancient egyptian culture, myths, architecture, and their contributions to the world.
      </li>
